<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">You can publish a link to a QlikView
document in the Qlik Sense hub instead of distributing files by e-mail or to a
specific folder location. You can use this method when you want to share a
QlikView document with a named user that is part of the Active Directory user
group in both QlikView and Qlik Sense. If each user has Qlikview desktop (not
Personal Edition) they can share the document between each other or access the
document between the QVW file from a common file location.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Qlik Sense<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Basically under Qlik Sense Cloud Basic (free) you can choose to
invite people to your shared My Stream - anyone who is invited can see the apps
available. (requires a Qlik Sense Cloud account). Or you can share a single
visualization (what we call Qlik Sense Charts) - this creates a URL that is
public (no Qlik Sense Cloud account required) and can be shared or embedded
freely.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Qlik Sense Cloud Business (subscription)&nbsp; - you can invite users to your workspace -
and publish apps to streams that are controlled by you. Anyone who is invited
can be a part of your workspace as long as you have purchased a seat for that
person.<o:p></o:p></p>
